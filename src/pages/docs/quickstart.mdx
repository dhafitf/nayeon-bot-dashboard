# Quick Start

Nayeon bot is a bot dedicated to notifying updates from TWICE, and also provides other commands. We are still developing, and hope this bot can reach a wider range of users and not just for TWICE fans.

## Getting Started

Nayeon is simple to use. You can invite it to your server using [this link](/invite).
